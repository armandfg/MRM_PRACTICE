NAMING GROUPS
By creating a file called "naming_groups.txt" and placing it in the "new_config" folder 
with the following contents inside the brackets (group1,group2,group3), this will tell NEWT that you
have various components files that have these strings in the name that you would like to group together. For example, when one 
HTML file is seleted in the group dropdown that has a file name that contains "group1", the other HTML files from 
other components that also have file names that contain the string "group1" will automatically be selected.
